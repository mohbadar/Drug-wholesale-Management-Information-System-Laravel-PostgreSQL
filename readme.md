<h1>Adwanya : Drug Wholesale Open Source System</h1>

Majority of small-sized drug wholesale companies do not have any system to manage their daily activities. Or even they cannot afford buying or developing a system. However, I having a system allows companies to significantly improve their productivity and also have a clear and accurate view of their stocks, for instance, they can easily see the expired and nearly expired drug items in the stocks. Thus, I decided to develop an open-source system for them. This system can manage daily information. 

 In the following list, I have highlighted some of the functionalities of the system:
       <ul>
            <li>Tracking incoming and outgoing items.</li>
             <li>Tracking the expiration date for each item. </li>
            <li>Generating reports for sales </li>
            <li>Generating reports for list of items in stock.</li>
             <li>Tracking Expenses.</li>
            <li>Generating reports for status of stocks.</li> 
             <li>Tracking Loans</li>
             <li>Generating reports of loans</li>
            <li>Tracking Bills and Invoices</li> 
            <li>And More</li>         
       </ul>
